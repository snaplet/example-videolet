# Snaplet Demo App: "VideoLet"

This is an example application (Written in RedwoodJS) that's used to demo some of the power of [Snaplet](https://snaplet.dev).

For this demo to be effective try to imagine that you just got hired at "VideoLet," a struggling video rental chain (See ["Video Rental Shop"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_rental_shop), and [THE LAST BLOCKBUSTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov9ls_3tJ1Y)), as the new webmaster! Congrats! You're desperately needed to breathe fresh life into the website. Good luck!

## Setup

```terminal
yarn install
yarn rw dev
```
